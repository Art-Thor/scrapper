Question_MQ_Parsed_Culture_Normal_0062,Culture,Humanities,Normal,Spiritual or religious love and the comforts it offers are common themes in Renaissance art. Madonna and Child was painted countless times. What is a bit disconcerting about most babies painted during the earliest Renaissance?,Massive appetites,Missing hands,Ghostly pale,Odd body proportions,Odd body proportions,"One explanation is that most painters had little exposure to real infants, babies make impatient models, and the mastery of perspective was as yet undeveloped. Both kids and babies resemble adults in tiny form, with therefore odd-sized limbs, wrinkly elbows and heads too large. Sometimes baby eyes are quite strange. In the later Renaissance Jan Van Eyck, Robert Campin and others made advances in proportion and perspective. They achieved more accurate baby figures, and set both mother and child in more realistic poses. Still, misshapen or no, babies in this period were generally portrayed as well-fed, well-loved and happy. Many Renaissance paintings of the Virgin Madonna and Child are as beautiful and warm as one could imagine. The Madonna sits with baby Jesus in her lap, or she is breastfeeding, looking very much a mother soothing her beloved infant. The clothes, colors and surroundings are lush, the poses serene. In some, called as a group ""Madonna Enthroned"", she and the infant Jesus are surreal beings, surrounded by angels and saints. They may both pray or make holy gestures.

In interesting opposition were Italian ""sumptuary laws"" a code restricting displays of vanity and wealth like showy fabrics or elaborate capes.

The Brotherhood believed in sharp, superb detail, with very bright colors. They often rendered poverty, prostitution, emigration and sexuality, uncommon in the more idyllic Renaissance. They greatly upset the British, including Charles Dickens, by (for example) painting a young Jesus in what some called a ""slum"" home with an ""ugly"" mother, ""Christ in the House of His Parents"" by John Everett Millais, 1850.

Each food carried symbolic meaning and even messages, representing the divine, virtues, class, and eroticism, evoking the satisfactions and comfort of eating. Raphael was partial to figs, melons and peaches in his works. A commonly painted meal is called ""biancomangiare"", a soothing restorative of shredded chicken and almond milk in a bowl, intended for women in childbirth, or to nourish the occupants of a monastery, but later a favorite at the banquets of the nobles, and still made today. The Venetian painter Vittore Carpaccio created a sacred scene, ""Birth of the Virgin"" (about 1502), which shows a woman bringing this dish to the bedside of Anna. An angel holds the newborn, and there is an overall sense of peace. Quite often we see shared religious meals, such as Leonardo da Vinci's masterpiece ""Last Supper"" and Paolo Veronese's ""Feast in the House of Levi"" (1573). As an aside, Veronese was summoned to account by the Holy Tribunal inquisitor, because the painting, they said, depicted dwarfs, drunks and buffoons in company with Christ. Veronese saved himself by arguing they were decently far from Christ's table, and changing the title. Very often the common person is portrayed with food, such as Annibale Carracci's ""The Bean Eater"" (about 1583) or Bartolomeo Passerotti's ""The Butchers Shop"" (1580).

Calchas, a seer, saw two eagles descend on a hare and kill it, and interpreted it as an omen that Agamemnon should sacrifice Iphigenia. In Euripides' 'Iphigenia at Aulis', Agamemnon sent a message to Clytemnestra, telling her to bring Iphigenia to Aulis so that she could marry Achilles, then changed his mind and had a second message sent, but Menelaus intercepted it. It was too late anyway, as Clytemnestra and Iphigenia were already en route. Clytemnestra, Achilles, and Iphigenia later discovered that the marriage was a pretext for sacrificing Iphigenia. Both she and Clytemnestra pleaded with Agamemnon to change his mind, and Achilles also tried to rally the Greeks into stopping the sacrifice, but he was outnumbered. Iphigenia eventually consented to be sacrificed, despite Clytemnestra's protests, and begged Achilles not to throw away his life.

On top there is one goose, very elaborate. In the next lines there are more geese, with less detail, and suddenly the focus shifts to the fish formed by the empty spaces between the geese. The bottom line is a very elaborate fish. You're looking at ""Sky and Water"", one of the many interesting drawings made by a Dutch artist, also known for his works with startling perspective. Who was this artist?",Piet Mondrian,Maurits Cornelius Escher,Gerrit Rietveld,Dick Bruna,Maurits Cornelius Escher,"Escher's best known works are either metamorphoses such as ""Sky and Water"", or renderings of buildings with changing perspectives (so that, for instance, a man can walk upstairs, take four right angles and arrive at his starting point without ever moving downstairs). Escher was also inspired by the Möbius strip. Dick Bruna (born 1927) is best known for his children's books series ""Miffy"" (in Dutch: ""Nijntje""), with illustrations by the author himself. Rietveld (1888-1964) was a Dutch furniture designer and architect. His most recognisable work is the ""Red and Blue Chair"".

Snyders was one of the first artists specialising in adequate rendering of animals (live or dead). The painting above apparently bears a wrong title. It's in fact a still life with lobster, poultry and fruit, whilst the crab mentioned in the title can't be found anywhere. You'll find a cooked lobster on a plate, some bunches of grapes (white and blue grapes), a platter with strawberries, raspberries and currants, and a plucked turkey.

Question_MQ_Parsed_Culture_Normal_0163,Culture,Humanities,Normal,"Diego Velazquez has left us several hunting portraits of members of the Spanish Habsburg family. Which animal did Velazquez paint in the hunting portraits of Cardinal Infante Don Fernando, King Philip IV and the young Prince Baltasar Carlos?",Dog,Boar,Stag,Fox,Dog,"So a hunting portrait shows us some man with his dog and / or his horse. Usually this portrait renders the hunter and his animal companion(s) before the start of the hunt. The stag, boar or fox are typical prey for a hunting party. If these animals are depicted, it is in a painting of the moment supreme of a hunting party. In each of the paintings I've mentioned in this question, a different dog appears. I would identify Don Fernando's dog as a Great Dane, King Philip's dog as a German shepherd (though this one is very hard to recognise), and Prince Baltasar Carlos' dog as a Saint Bernard. If you can ascertain one or more of these breeds on the paintings, please inform me. Velazquez (1599-1660) is best known for his painting ""Las Meninas"", a portrait of the Infanta Margarita with some of her servants.

Question_MQ_Parsed_Culture_Normal_0164,Culture,Humanities,Normal,"Let's take a look at ""Olympia"" (1863). It shows us a nude woman reclining on a divan. Oh come on guys, don't keep staring at that particular place, but shift your regard to her bare feet. You'll find (by looking very carefully) a black cat at Olympia's feet. Who scandalized Paris with this painting?",Manet,Giorgione,Titian,Botticelli,Manet,"He had already provoked quite a revolt with his ""Luncheon on the Grass"" earlier in 1863, but this nude portrait shocked the art critics even more. Nudity was not uncommon in artworks depicting mythical or sometimes even biblical people - remember for instance ""Susanna and the Elders"" by various Renaissance and Baroque artists. But the nude woman in Manet's painting ""Olympia"" can clearly be identified as a prostitute - a profession that should never be alluded to in public (according to the ethical code of the 1860's). Several details refer to Olympia's profession: she's wearing an orchid in her hair, her maid servant is from African descent, and, to make things even worse, there's a black cat at her feet. The black cat was at that time the typical companion of prostitutes. Manet was probably inspired by the ""Venus of Urbino"" by Titian and the ""Sleeping Venus"" by Giorgione, with a nude lady in exactly the same pose. The ""Maja Desnuda"" by Goya can have had its influence on Manet, too. Titian (1488-1576), Giorgione (1478-1510) and Sandro Botticelli (1445-1510) were Renaissance painters. All of these have a masterpiece that depicts a nude woman. Titian's and Giorgione's paintings have been mentioned before, and Botticelli has painted a very famous ""Birth of Venus"".",,https://www.funtrivia.com/quiz/humanities/pictures-at-an-exhibition-animals-abounding-354700.html

He is best known for his frescos in the Vatican (including the ""School of Athens"") and for his numerous Madonnas. In the painting ""Madonna del Cardellino"", the little bird caught by John the Baptist is a goldfinch. Because this bird feeds on roses (between the thorns), it reminds the contemporary spectators of the crown of thorns which Christ will carry just before the crucifixion.

Who was the artist who had instant success with this elaborate work?",William Hogarth,Gustave Doré,John James Audubon,Aubrey Beardsley,John James Audubon,"To avoid being conscripted for the Napoleonic wars, he was sent to America in 1803, where he anglicized his first names (originally named Jean Jacques). Even during his childhood, Audubon was fascinated by birds. He would take long walks in forested areas, only to observe the birds and explore their nests. His father tried to raise Jean Jacques as a sailor, but to no avail. For the original ""Birds of America"", Audubon's drawings were used, and coloured by over fifty assistants. Later editions use lithographic prints. Audubon died in 1851. Gustave Doré (1832-1883) was a French etcher and book illustrator. Some books illustrated by Doré are the Bible and Milton's ""Paradise Lost"". Hogarth (1697-1764) was a British painter and printmaker.

Rockefeller,Howard Hughes,Bill Gates,Nelson Bunker Hunt,Howard Hughes,"Once an affable, if somewhat difficult, persona, by the late 1950s Hughes had become an obsessive germaphobe and was almost totally reclusive, exclusively conducting his business from a succession of hotels around the world. In 1970, journalist Clifford Irving met his friend Richard Suskind in Spain; the two concocted a plan whereby Irving would write a fake ""autobiography"" of Hughes, believing that Hughes' by now legendary reclusiveness would ensure that he wouldn't denounce their book or sue for libel. Using forged correspondence between himself and Hughes, Irving convinced his publisher, McGraw-Hill, that Hughes had authorised him to ghostwrite his autobiography, and McGraw-Hill paid over $750,000 to Irving for his efforts. The proposed book quickly attracted the attention of representatives of Hughes' companies, who publicly denounced its veracity. On January 7, 1972, Howard Hughes himself arranged a telephone conference where he explicitly denied ever meeting or corresponding with Irving, or authorising him to write anything. With the jig up, Irving admitted to the hoax a few weeks later; Irving and his wife Edith, as well as Suskind, were indicted for the fraud. All three served prison sentences for their part in the fraud; however Irving did voluntarily return the money he had paid by McGraw-Hill.

Which of the following has NOT been broached as a way of reducing carbon emissions from cruise ships?",Wind sails,Solar Power,Steam,Shoreside electricity,Steam,"These engines use heavy fuel oil (HFO) at an astronomical rate and, of necessity, some large ships have a storage capacity of 4.5 to 9 million litres (1 to 2 million gallons) of fuel. This fuel is not only toxic to the environment if it leaks, it also contains high amounts of sulphur which them produces sulphur dioxide which is a major contributor to acid rain. Another by-product of HFO and MGO burning is nitrogen oxide, which can cause serious lung diseases. HFO is also thick and viscous so if a spill does happen, it is hard to clean up and has a devastating effect on wildlife. The Cruise Line Industry Association (CLIA) is making progress in implementing sustainable technologies and practice and ""are making an industry-wide emissions commitment to reduce carbon emissions by 40 per cent by 2030."" (Cruise International 2020). One proposed way of using less fuel is by using shoreside electricity (created by renewable energy) while in port, so the ship's engines can be turned off. It is also proposed that this electricity could be stored in batteries and used for power on board. Solar power is also being trialled. Many European river cruises are installing solar panels on the flat roofs of their ships to provide free and sustainable power. The possibility of using wind power is also being looked into.

Question_MQ_Parsed_Geography_Normal_0182,Geography,Geography,Normal,"While gas exhaust is a global problem, which areas are at particular risk from cruise exhaust?",Equatorial islands,Arctic and Antarctic regions,Shallow bays and reefs,Mediterranean and Caribbean Seas,Arctic and Antarctic regions,"This soot is having a heavy impact on the Arctic in particular as it lands on the ice and permafrost ground where it absorbs warmth from the sun. This leads to melting of the snow and ice and the run-off warms the land and oceans. Studies have shown that these greenhouse gas emissions would contribute to increase global warming significantly by 2030. Cruise ships were the first of all globally operating ships to install scrubbers to reduce their carbon emissions. These scrubbers were fitted inside the funnel to neutralise the exhaust gases. In 2022 there are two types of scrubbers - an open system or a closed system. The open system was adopted by older ships and uses sea water to clean the gases. Sea water is pumped into a tank and gases forced through it, removing (trapping) the harmful emissions so cleaner exhaust gas is released. The contaminated water is then filtered, and the sludge collected for disposal ashore. Newer ships have a closed-system scrubbers which use fresh water and alkaline chemicals to neutralise the exhaust. This fresh water is then recycled back into the scrubber. Older ships, many of which could not be retrofitted with scrubbers, were sold for scrap during the 2020 pandemic when cruising was on hold. Hurtigruten's MS Roald Amundsen became the world's first hybrid-powered ship, running on liquid natural gas and can also run off battery power for an hour at a time. As these cruises operate primarily in the Arctic and Antarctic regions, the company is committed to reducing their own carbon footprint and is increasing their fleet of hybrid-powered ships.

Question_MQ_Parsed_Geography_Normal_0183,Geography,Geography,Normal,Older cruise ships use a propeller and shaft system to push through the water. What new propulsion system sits outside the hull and can turn 360 degrees to give directional momentum?,Voith-Shneider cyclorotor,Azimuth thrusters,Oscillating flappers,Nuclear propulsion systems,Azimuth thrusters,"Initially developed for icebreakers, the increased fuel efficiency and manoeuvrability was quickly recognized as applicable to cruise ships. The Carnival Elation, launched in 1998, was the first cruise ship fitted with an Azipod propulsion system; most new cruise ships are built with azimuth thrusters. In addition to improved fuel efficiency, noise is reduced because the system is completely outside the hull and there are no gears to generate noise, and no stern thruster is required. Vessels with these units can stop more quickly than those with shaft driven propeller systems; this is another way fuel consumption is reduced. Because of the increased manoeuvrability, ships can directly back out of ports or use a much smaller turning radius, causing less disruption to a fragile marine environment and again lower fuel consumption. The Voith-Shneider cyclorotor is an older type of azimuth thruster that is generally installed on ferries and tugboats, not cruise ships. Oscillating flappers are pedal-driven systems on kayaks, and nuclear propulsion is used primarily on military ships.

Question_MQ_Parsed_Geography_Normal_0184,Geography,Geography,Normal,There are four types of waste water on ships. Which one is the sewerage waste?,Blackwater,Bilge water,Greywater,Ballast water,Blackwater,"Of the four types of waste water found on a ship, blackwater (which comes from toilets and the ship's medical facilities, and is obviously the most polluted) requires biological or chemical treatment and disinfection before it is safe to discharge. All modern cruise ships must have their own wastewater treatment plant on board. In order to treat sewage properly prior to its being discharged, several steps must be followed. Blackwater treatment stage takes place in bioreactors deep into the bowels of the ship, where the waste in blackwater is filtered out and digested by bacteria. The treated water is then disinfected with chlorination or UV radiation, and becomes environmentally safe to offload. The sludge removed from the water during treatment is stored in tanks for further processing, or pumped ashore for disposal. While in the past it was not uncommon for cruise ships to dump their waste into the sea, in recent years international regulations have become much stricter. Per international maritime law, sewage cannot be discharged directly into the sea - unless it is treated, and the ship is at least 4 nautical miles from the nearest land. Greywater (the water from sinks, showers, and laundries) is stored in separate tanks, since this waste water requires minimal filtration before it can be discharged into the sea. Bilge water results from condensation from the engine rooms, and must also be treated carefully in order to separate any traces of oil residue from the water. Ballast water, on the other hand, is seawater taken in by a ship to increase stability, and stored in appropriate tanks: since it may contain microorganisms that may di",,https://www.funtrivia.com/quiz/world/cruising-to-a-sustainable-future-410669.html

One of these tasks is laundry. With ships that can house up to 6680 passengers and an extra 2200 crew the amount of dirty washing that is produced is phenomenal, especially on embarkation day. The laundry is usually located below the waterline and will be equipped with huge industrial washers and tunnel dryers. The system is set up to be conscious of the environment and to use existing resources. Water that condenses from the air conditioner system is piped to the laundry to be used in the machines, after being heated up using heat that is produced by the engines that power the ship. The detergent is phosphate free in order to minimize its impact on the sea. Passengers are encouraged to reduce the number of towels that they use, as this is the biggest laundry item. As well as those used within the cabins, the on-board spas and water attractions also produce towel laundry. Some of the restaurants onboard have moved away from the usage of tablecloths, looking for a slightly more casual atmosphere, which has a happy benefit of reducing the laundry load. The ships still use cloth napkins, as the washing of these is less harmful than the use of paper napkins.

What happens to the uneaten food?","Pulverised, treated and released",Leftovers are used to make subsequent meals wherever possible,The crew eat the leftovers,Donated to charity,"Pulverised, treated and released","While you would expect a lot of wastage, the cruise industry has become very proficient at calculating how much food is required, and overall there is much less waste than expected. Left-over food is first sorted, so all foreign objects (satay sticks, paper etc) are removed and the rest is then pulverised in large industrial grinders. It is then reduced, cleaned and sterilized. There are then two ways to dispose of this organic waste. The first is to mix it with water and pump into the sea. Research has shown that it is safe to pump this waste into the ocean as fish food. Cruise lines are now turning to even more environmentally friendly options. The treated food waste is offloaded at port where it is taken to be turned into soil fertiliser or (in a Finnish initiative) turned into biogas used in vehicles. The Norwegian Cruise Line is also looking into ways this biogas can be used to power their ships. Despite popular myth, the crew do not eat the leftovers. With the crew representing several different countries and religions, not to mention the occupations and caloric requirements of various crew (a dancer or laundry/engine room worker compared to those manning the office), the crew's menu must cater to all of their requirements. In days (long) gone by it was not unusual to find last night's roast recycled into a curry, but not anymore. After food has been cooked, even if it is left totally uneaten, it must be discarded. The cruising industry is heavily regulated and food standards are scrutinised as a component of the regulatory process. Leftovers are never donated to charity. Again, regulatory processes prevent this no matter how admirable the cause. You can't reuse le",,https://www.funtrivia.com/quiz/world/cruising-to-a-sustainable-future-410669.html
Question_MQ_Parsed_Geography_Normal_0188,Geography,Geography,Normal,Cruise lines are also prioritizing wildlife and ecosystem conservation to protect their destination ports. Which is one way cruise ships are able to protect fragile ecosystems and reefs?,Using local port tug boats,Running tender boats up to shore,Not dropping anchor,Building bigger docks for bigger ships,Not dropping anchor,"In those ports, ships traditionally drop the anchor and ferry the passengers to the pier in tender boats. These anchors which can weigh more than 27,000kg (60,000lbs) imbed into the seabed and as the currents and winds push the ship around, the anchor and chain abrades the seabed and digs up sediment. A study released in May 2022 reported that the constant movement leaves long-term 'broom-stick' type abrasions that are still visible four years later. Marine life is killed off and carbon stores are released into the water. Newer ships now use a Dynamic Positioning System (DPS) and this combined with the use of azimuth thrusters can keep the ship's position stable without having to drop anchor. There are other ways cruises are trying to help with the environment. Some cruise lines partner with outside agencies, such as World Wildlife Fund, to promote ocean conservation. Some ships collect data for climate change research, track polar bears, and assist in DNA collection for critically endangered turtles. Many tours at local ports promote conservation education. Various ports (like Komodo Island) will not allow disembarkation unless you are doing a sanctioned tour, while others, such as Venice, have banned cruise ships altogether.

On the north is Mount Ebal and to the south is Mount Gerizim, so the use of a typical square city map (as was habitual in Roman times and as also can be found in some of the newer American cities) proved difficult. Streets would still intersect at more or less right angles, but the map seems squeezed in the north-south axis. Some of the places to visit just outside Nablus are Joseph's tomb and the Greek Orthodox Church of Jacob's Well. Indeed: Jacob, the grandson of Abraham, would have lived in this region, as well as Jacob's sons (including Joseph). But there are also several mosques, Turkish bath houses and ancient palaces. One typical specialty is the soap factories, of which about a quarter still are active making soap from olive oil. The red herrings are cities with which Nablus has signed ""twin city"" pacts.

Her grief was so profound that, according to the myth, she was transformed into a fountain, symbolizing her eternal connection to the king and the city he helped shape. For those who prefer a less magical version of the story, according to Livy's account, Numa feared that without external threats, people would become lazy and undisciplined.

While the onlookers stood shocked and afraid, Lucius marched confidently to the royal seat and sat upon the throne. He denounced Servius as a slave-born usurper.

When negotiations failed, both sides prepared for what Livy characterizes as nearly a civil war, since both peoples claimed descent from Trojan ancestors. To avoid mutual destruction and prevent Etruscan intervention, they agreed to settle the conflict through a combat between two sets of three brothers - the Roman Horatii and the Alban Curiatii. The duel ended in victory for Rome. After the Roman victory, Alba Longa was bound by treaty to follow Rome's lead. However, not long after, the Alban king Mettius Fufetius betrayed the alliance by secretly allying with the Etruscans against Rome.

Prior to his election he was a member of the U.S. House of Representatives, serving from 1916 until his mayoral election. The opposite of prior mayor Jimmy Walker, he was elected as an ""anti-corruption"" candidate, and after election, he promptly started cleaning up the city by having alleged gangster Lucky Luciano arrested, and sending a task force out to destroy the illegal slot machines that were proliferating the city. He also got the city back on its feet by creating new jobs to help recover from the Depression, and also reformed the New York City Charter. He was appointed by President Franklin Roosevelt to the position of director of The Office Of Civilian Defense during the beginning of World War II, but was replaced after the war started. During 1945, his last year in office, he went on public radio during a newspaper strike, and read the comics on the air. Although short of stature (only 5' 2"" tall), he left a huge legacy as one of the finest mayors New York City ever had.

Wagner Jr.,"Wagner Jr. Wagner was elected for the first time in the election of 1953, succeeding Mayor Vincent Impellitteri. He was the son of New York Senator Robert Wagner. He had previously been Manhattan Borough President, and his run for mayor created a rift in the Democratic Party. He won election rather easily and was responsible for some major reforms in New York during his 12 year tenure. Some of his accomplishments while mayor were the establishment of the City University of New York system, and the establishment of the right of collective bargaining for city employees. He also banned housing discrimination based on race, color, or religion, and was the first mayor to hire a significant number of persons of color for positions in his administration. For sports enthusiasts, after the Brooklyn Dodgers and New York Giants left New York City for California in 1957, he established a commission whose purpose was to bring another National League team to New York, and out of this commission came The New York Mets, in 1962. Wagner also established The Landmarks Preservation Commission.

Question_MQ_Parsed_Geography_Normal_0234,Geography,Geography,Normal,This former mayor was a congressman for six years before winning the mayoral election of 1965. He presided over some of the most turbulent times in city history between 1966 and 1973. Who was he?,John Hoffman,John O'Brien,John Lindsay,Edward Cooper,John Lindsay,"He won election to the mayoral post in 1965 in a three man race. He walked into a buzzsaw so to speak, with the economic and fiscal problems left over by outgoing mayor Robert Wagner Jr. Jobs in the city were disappearing, many middle class families were abandoning the city for the suburbs, and the city unionized employees were playing hardball in contract negotiations. On his first day as mayor, the entire transit system was shutdown by a strike, which lasted twelve days, nearly crippling the city. The strike was ultimately settled, but at a cost to the taxpayers of course. In 1968, the public school teachers went on strike, followed later the same year by a sanitation workers strike. In February 1969, the city was hit with a 15 inch snowstorm, and the mayor was blamed and accused of favoring Manhattan at the expense of the outer boroughs in the priority of snow clearance. In May of 1970, the city was on the edge as there was a riot between construction workers and students protesting the Kent State College shootings. The police were accused by the mayor of standing by and doing nothing to protect the students. This created tension between the mayor and the police. Somehow, with all this going on, he won re-election to the post in the fall of 1969. He declined to seek a third term when his mayoralty expired in 1973. The best that can be said about Lindsay according to historians is that he guided the city through the rough racial times of the late 1960s with a minimum of damage.",,https://www.funtrivia.com/quiz/world/20th-century-new-york-city-mayors-302114.html

Who was he?",Hugh Carey,Mario Cuomo,Malcolm Wilson,Ed Koch,Hugh Carey,"Koch almost singlehandedly changed the face of the city during his three terms as mayor. During his first term he balanced the city budget, established a merit system for state judges, and broke a strike by the New York City transit workers, invoking the ""Taylor Law"" which prohibits strikes by public employees, and imposes heavy fines, and possible jail terms for strikers. When up for re-election in 1981, he ran virtual unopposed, showing up on both the Democratic and Republican tickets, receiving over 75% of the popular vote. He also was very outspoken on quality of life issues which brought him into direct conflict with many American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) leaders, as well as leaders from the African-American community. He was re-elected again in 1985, this time with about 78% of the votes. He suffered a mild stroke in 1987, but was able to continue in office. He finally lost, seeking his fourth term, largely due to his refusal to support Jesse Jackson in the 1988 New York Presidential primary. Koch, who was Jewish, reminded voters of Jackson's anti-Semitic views, and this angered many blacks in the city, contributing to Koch's demise in the mayoral primary election the following year.",,https://www.funtrivia.com/quiz/world/20th-century-new-york-city-mayors-302114.html

He entered office with a promise to promote racial healing in the city, but riots in the Crown Heights section of the city, and the boycott of a Korean grocery store owner by blacks did little to accomplish this. He was accused of ordering the police to hold back during the riots. The perception was the crime was out of control during his administration but the numbers say otherwise. Crime actually went down during his tenure as mayor. He actually did wonders for the city budget as well, entering with a $1.8 million deficit, and after making some tough budgetary cuts, was able to show a $200 million surplus just one year later.

He resigned from his government position after Ronald Reagan left office. He was elected in 1993 partly due to the public misconception that crime in the city was on the uptick, and he was strong on crime as evidenced by his work with the Federal Government and the Justice Department. In the end he beat David Dinkins by a 49% to 46% margin. He did clean up the streets and the petty crimes and nuisances disappeared during his first term. He was re-elected overwhelmingly in 1997 although the voter turnout for the election was said to be the lowest in 12 years. His mayoralty was cruising along into his second term when the sky fell all at once. He took a run at the U.S. Senate in 2000, but his campaign against his opponent, Hillary Clinton, was cut short due to his withdrawal from the race after being diagnosed with prostate cancer. He also separated from his wife Donna Hanover, after a extra-marital affair with Judith Nathan was made public.

Although painted around 1624, the provenance of the painting dates from a sale in 1770 in The Hague. Further sales led to its being purchased in 1822 by the Comte de Pourtalès-Gorgier, a Franco-Swiss collector, before being sold again after his death as part of the Comte's collection to the Marquess of Hertford who, after initially displaying it in his Paris home, brought it to London where it was displayed in the newly opened Bethnal Green Museum from 1872.

They speculate that the directions to the second half are also on the wreck, but on the part that had fallen over the ledge into water that was far too deep for sponge divers. They decide that their next move will be to explore the wreck and head to Greece. There they find a diver who is a friend of Indy's. They are diving so deep that he gives them only 3 minutes in the depths so that they can surface without getting the Bends. They find what they are looking for. Unfortunately Voller and his thugs are waiting when they surface, holding Teddy hostage. The directions are written in code which Indy refuses to read for them. Helena does read it (after they shoot Indy's friend) but gives them the wrong directions. She tells them what was written in the wax but has already determined that Archimedes was more clever than that and has concealed the real location. She, Indy and Teddy figure this out. The boat they dive from has been rendered unusable so they steal Voller's boat and go racing off in the right direction. Voller watches through binoculars and notes that they are not going the way they told him to go. So he of course follows when he can.

'Donkey Ride at La Roche-Guyon' dates from around 1865 - before the start of Impressionism - when Pissarro was working closely with painters such as Monet and Cezanne. At this time his realist style led to many of his paintings being refused by the highly influential Salon, the official exhibition of the Académie des Beaux-Arts that was originally set up and patronised by the French royal family.

This bird is found in most of Europe and Asia, as well as parts of North Africa and central sub-Saharan Africa, where it inhabits a wide range of ecosystems. The Eurasian hoopoe is a medium-sized bird, with a long, tapering bill; its plumage is a beautiful cinnamon colour, while its wings are black and white. Its most striking feature, however, is its tall crest of black-tipped feathers. This bird is mainly insectivorous, which makes it useful to humans because it eats various kinds of agricultural pests. The Eurasian hoopoe has been known to humans since antiquity. While revered and highly regarded in Ancient Egypt and Persia, in much of Europe the hoopoe was seen as a harbinger of war and death. In the Old Testament, it is mentioned as unclean, and thus unfit to be eaten - probably because of the foul-smelling liquid secreted by brooding females for defence. In spite of the bird not being kosher, in 2008, on the occasion of the celebrations for the country's 80th birthday, the hoopoe was chosen as the national bird of Israel, where it is quite common.

When diving, cormorants propel themselves by using their feet and wings. The European shag is one of two species of cormorant (the other being the great cormorant) that is commonly seen in the British Isles. It is also found along the western and northern coasts of the Scandinavian Peninsula, in western Iceland, on the eastern Adriatic coast (Dalmatia), and in the Greek islands.

King In a tiny sharecropper's shack on a cotton plantation in Itta Bena, Mississippi, Riley B. King (better known as B.B. King) was born to Albert and Nora Ella King, on September 16, 1925. B.B. grew up enduring hard times, which he poured into his songwriting and singing. A small town preacher showed him how to play the guitar in the chords of E, A, and B, and King was soon playing and singing gospel throughout his teen-aged years. He'd play the blue's on several delta town street corners for tips. After working as a tractor driver on a cotton field plantation, earning only $1.00 per day, B.B. decided to follow his musical dream. In May, 1947, with $2.50 in his pocket and his guitar, he hitchhiked Highway 49 to Memphis, Tennessee. And as they say, ""the rest is history"". His first #1 hit was, ""Three O'Clock Blues"", but his most popular hit came in 1966 with, ""The Thrill is Gone"". In 1950, while playing in a club, a fight broke out among two guys over a woman named Lucille. A kerosene stove was accidentally knocked over, setting the place on fire. With the rush of excitement to get out like all the rest of the people, B.B. realized he had left his $30 electrical accoustic guitar behind. He ran back into the burning blaze to retrieve it, barely escaping with his life. From that day on, his guitars' became known as, ""Lucille"". King won nearly every award imaginable. He was inducted into the Blues Foundation Hall of Fame in 1984, and in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame in 1987. That same year, he recieved NARAS' Lifetime Achievement Grammy Award. In 1992, he recieved the National Award of Distinction from the University of Mississippi.

In 1952, they signed a contract with RCA Victor. Elvis Presley auditioned in 1953, but was turned down to join the group. This quartet was considered one of the greatest gospel quartets ever and paved the way for other musicians, setting the standard for the much loved sound of Southern Gospel music. In August of 1958, they were touring in North Carolina when Elvis had a plane chartered to fly them back to Memphis to sing at his Mother's funeral.

The child is depicted not as a plump infant, but as a perfectly formed little man, a tradition that would persist in Christian art until the Renaissance. The painting was on public display in Crete until about 1495, when it was purchased by a wealthy citizen for his own home. According to legend, a child who had seen the image had a vision in which the Virgin expressed her displeasure at the image's being removed from public veneration, and expressed her desire to be known to all Christians as their ""perpetual help"". The painting was subsequently displayed at the church of St. Matthew in Rome; it was spirited away during the invasion of Rome by the French in 1798, out of fear that it would be destroyed or desecrated.
